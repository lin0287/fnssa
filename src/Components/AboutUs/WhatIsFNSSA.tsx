    <h4>What is Flinders Neurodivergent Study Support and Advocacy?</h4>
      <p>
        Welcome, Neurodivergents at Flinders! This group is run by neurodivergent students, for neurodivergent students.
         We want you to feel comfortable and supported here and at university and are interested in providing resources
        specifically tailored to the additional needs of neurodivergent students, alongside facilitating connections.
        We want to empower people to self-advocate and create the best possible university experience for themselves
        and future students.

        What is Neurodivergency?
      </h4>
      <p>
        To be neurodivergent is to be differing in mental or neurological function from what is considered typical or
        normal. This could mean ASD or ADHD, BPD, DID, Epilepsy, the list goes on. If your brain works different and
        you feel you need support to accommodate that, this is the group for you even without official diagnosis.
