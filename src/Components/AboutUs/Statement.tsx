      <h4>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h4>
      <p>
        To us, diversity, inclusion, and equity, means that all neurodivergent students are accepted, valued, and
        adequately supported, for their individual differences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diversity is important because greater variability in our experiences, skills, and ideas, generates creativity
        and innovation. Improving diversity enriches the educational experience of all students. That’s why we
        recognise all neurodivergent individuals from all backgrounds, such as; race, ethnicity, gender, age,
        religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status,
        sociocultural factors, and more. Our commitment to diversity means that our group representatives and
        members recognise the value of diversity and will maintain a welcoming space for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inclusion is important in how a space is created and designed to value and empower our differences.
        We will encourage and provide regular opportunities for open dialogue, so that diverse perspectives,
        suggestions, and concerns can be communicated. Our group representatives will use this information to
        understand what and how we can improve the design of our group, and university, so that everyone feels
        valued and empowered to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equity is important as there are many systemic barriers that can disadvantage neurodivergent individuals.
        Our group representatives recognise that each neurodivergent individual will have different access to
        resources and privileges. Some individuals may need extra support, and this knowledge will be reflected
        in how and what our group advocates for. Our goal is to eliminate these barriers, both within our group,
        and within the university, as much as possible. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to the group
        representatives if there are circumstances preventing you from fully participating/engaging in this group,
        or at university. However big or small, your experiences are valid, important in our community, and our
        commitments to diversity, inclusivity, and equity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we will commit to continual re-evaluation in our approaches to diversity, inclusivity, and equity,
        and will rectify them when they are found to be lacking.
